## Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs

Writing maintainable and readable programs requires separating functionality into reusable components. In Project One, I developed a CRUD Python module that handled all database interactions independently from the dashboard application. This allowed the dashboard created in Project Two to focus only on visualization and user interaction rather than database logic.

Using this modular approach improved readability and adaptability because database changes could be handled within the CRUD module without modifying dashboard code. In the future, this CRUD module could be reused for other dashboards, reporting tools, or automation systems that require MongoDB connectivity.

## Problem-Solving Approach as a Computer Scientist

When developing the Grazioso Salvare dashboard, I approached the problem by first understanding client requirements and translating them into technical components such as database queries, filters, and visualization tools. Unlike previous assignments that focused primarily on isolated coding exercises, this project required integrating databases, backend logic, and front-end visualization.

I broke the problem into stages:
- Database connection
- Data retrieval
- Interactive filtering
- Visualization
- Geographic mapping

In future projects, I would continue using incremental development, testing each component independently before integrating the full system.

## What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters

Computer scientists design systems that transform raw data into meaningful insights that support decision-making. In this project, the dashboard allows Grazioso Salvare to quickly identify dogs suited for specific rescue operations using automated filtering and visualization.

This type of system improves organizational efficiency by reducing manual data analysis and enabling faster operational decisions. Solutions like this help companies better allocate resources, improve response times, and ultimately perform their work more effectively.
